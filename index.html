                    <h2>Now, this is a story all about how</h2>
                    <p>
                        My life got flipped-turned upside down
                        <br>
                        And I'd like to take a minute
                        <br>
                        Just sit right there
                        <br>
    
                        <br>
                        I'll tell you how I met this amazing girl in the state of CO
                        <br>
                        In Eastern Ohio I was born and raised
                        <br>
                        In the country is where I spent most of my days
                        <br>
                        BROWSEn' and SCROLLn' "MEMEn' around
                        <br>
                        And gaming when I wasn't workn' bound
                        <br>
    
                        <br>
                        When a cute girl sent a gif to a comment I made
                        <br>
                        It was clear the feelings weren't going to fade
                        <br>
                        I sent one little DM in an attempt to flirt
                        <br>
                        I said "I'm flying to Colorado to see the treasure I found"
                        <br>
    
                        <br>
                        I worried and doubted that this girl was real
                        <br>
                        I saw her and knew She is the one I need, I feel
                        <br>
                        She gave me a kiss and we worked out the distance
                        <br>
                        Together we weathered a pandemic with just a little resistance

                        <p>
                            I worked with my employer to transfer to Colorado and as of 02/14/2020, I moved in with my partner. 
                            <h3>I was looking forward to:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Exploring the city that was new to me with my partner</li>
                                    <li>Going on dates</li>
                                    <li>Long drives through the mountains with her hand in mine</li>
                                    <li>And starting a new life with my partner</li>
                                </ul>
                            Covid-19 had different plans for us though!
                            We instead spent nearly the entire first year together transitioning to working from home together within the same four walls without much time away from each other.
                            It would be untruthful to say that everything was perfect during lockdown with each other; Happily our relationship has not only endured but has blossomed during this time.
                            Now we get to enjoy relaxing on the couch together, listening to our puppies snore.
