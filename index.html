                    <h2>Now, this is a story all about how</h2>
                    <p>
                        My life got flipped-turned upside down
                        <br>
                        And I like to take a minute
                        <br>
                        Just sit right there
                        <br>
    
                        <br>
                        I'll tell you how I met this amazing girl in the state of CO
                        <br>
                        In West Ohio I was born and raised
                        <br>
                        In the country is where I spent most of my days
                        <br>
                        BROWSEn' and SCROLLn' "MEMEn' around
                        <br>
                        And gaming when I wasn't workn' bound
                        <br>
    
                        <br>
                        When a cute girl sent a gif to a comment I made
                        <br>
                        It was clear the feelings weren't going to fade
                        <br>
                        I sent one little DM in an attempt to flirt
                        <br>
                        I said "I'm flying to Colorado to see the treasure I found"
                        <br>
    
                        <br>
                        I worried and doubted that this girl was real
                        <br>
                        I saw her and knew She is the one I need, I feel
                        <br>
                        She gave me a kiss and we worked out the distance
                        <br>
                        Together we weathered a pandemic with just a little resistance
